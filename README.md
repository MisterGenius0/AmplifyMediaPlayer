# amplifying_mediaplayer

This is a music app that I have worked on in my free time.

Its goal is to host an organized version of a music library in a fun and intuitive interface

how to use:
1. download the latest Windows download on GitHub
2. run the EXE
3. press the "+" (add source) button
4. Link to a folder with music for example you can select the music folder in windows
5. it will find music in the folder and organize it automatically **(NOTE: currently there is no loading or auto refresh when it's done, wait a minute or 2 then restart the app)**
6. you should see your music organized into groups.
7. click on the square to play the song by shuffle or play from the start
8. enjoy :)

Known issue:
1. The app doesn't refresh automatically after searching for media (you need to restart the app to update the interface)
2. The shuffle button doesn't work on the first press you need to press it twice
3. can't move the seek bar to jump around in the song
4. The refresh button doesn't do anything
